/// from numpy docs:
/// Construct an array by repeating A the number of times given by reps.

/// If `reps` has length `d`, the result will have dimension of `max(d, A.ndim)`.

/// If `A.ndim < d`, `A` is promoted to be d-dimensional by prepending new axes. So a shape (3,) array is promoted to (1, 3) for 2-D replication, or shape (1, 1, 3) for 3-D replication. If this is not the desired behavior, promote `A` to d-dimensions manually before calling this function.

/// If `A.ndim > d`, `reps` is promoted to `A`.ndim by pre-pending 1's to it. Thus for an `A` of shape (2, 3, 4, 5), a `reps` of (2, 2) is treated as (1, 1, 2, 2).
